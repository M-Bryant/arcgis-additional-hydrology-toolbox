arcgis-additional-hydrology-toolbox
============================================

The Additional Hydrology Tools provides a collection of geoprocessing tools for working with hydrology.
The toolbox is conveniently organized into toolsets which define the general sequence of tasks accomplished by the tools.

## Features

* Trace Downstream - determines the path water will take from a particular location to its furthest downhill path.
User must also supply a D8 flow direction grid.

If an optional surface raster is supplied, the trace is returned as a 3d line.

Perhaps a start on a tool that allows you to set up an in-house hydrology geoprocessing service.

## Installation Instructions

To simply use the toolbox, download the the .zip file.
Or fork and then clone the repo.

## Requirements

* ArcGIS 10.1+

## Resources
